# Arduino_Bases_MotorControl_Pickandplace_Project
#This project demonstrates an Arduino-based system for controlling multiple servo motors and DC motors using L298 motor drivers. The system allows for precise control of five servos and the movement of two DC motors #(forward, backward, left, right) via Bluetooth commands. Key features include adjustable motor speed, real-time servo adjustments, and Bluetooth-based remote control. The setup includes Arduino Uno, L298N motor #drivers, servo motors, and a Bluetooth module, making it suitable for robotics and automation projects requiring motor coordination and wireless control.
